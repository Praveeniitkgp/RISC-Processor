# RISC-Processor

This repository contains the design and implementation of a **RISC-based processor** developed as course project. The processor was implemented on FPGA and tested with multiple assembly programs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **RISC architecture** with a simple instruction set
- Separate instruction and data memory (`.coe` initialization files)
- Programs assembled into machine code and loaded into memory
- FPGA bitstreams (`.bit` files) for hardware testing
